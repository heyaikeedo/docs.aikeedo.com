## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have configured your server. For more information, refer to the [Server Requirements](/get-started/requirements) guide.

## Installation Steps

1. **Upload Archive:**

   - Locate the archive named **aikeedo-server-files.zip** in the extracted package.
   - If you couldn't find the file, refer to the [File Structure](/get-started/file-structure) guide for assistance.
   - Upload the **aikeedo-server-files.zip** archive to your server to desired location other than the public directory. This step is crucial for security purposes.

2. **Extract Files on the Server:**

   - Unzip the contents of the archive on your server. This step is crucial for accessing the Aikeedo files and directories.

3. **Set Public Directory as the Root:**

   - You should find a directory named **public** inside the extracted archive. This directory contains all the files that should be accessible to the public. Point your domain or subdomain to this directory to set it as the root.

4. **Access Installation Page:**

   - Open a web browser and enter your domain or subdomain URL.
   - It should automatically redirect you to the installation page located at `/install`. If not, manually go to `http://yourdomain.com/install`.

5. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**

   - The installation wizard will guide you through the setup process.
   - You will be prompted to provide Database Credentials, Purchase Code, and Admin Account Details.
   - Follow the instructions carefully to complete the installation.

6. **Complete Installation:**
   - Once you have provided all the necessary information, the installation wizard will finalize the setup.
