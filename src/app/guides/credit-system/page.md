Learn how to use the unified credit system in Aikeedo to manage usage credits in plans. {% .lead %}

With the release of Aikeedo v2.0, all previous usage units (tokens, image count and audio seconds) are replaced with a single unit: Credits. This change simplifies the usage management process and allows you to define credit conversion ratios in the Admin UI.

We've also introduced a calculator (available through Google Sheets) to help you calculate credit conversion ratios. The calculator is available for free to Extended License users.

## Access the calculator:

You can access the calculator at the following link: [Aikeedo Price Calculator](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AHqGqHT6tQyRwRxS2v2j0RngxGbqr_pA?usp=drive_link)

{% callout type="warning" title="Important" %}
The calculator is not part of the item and is available only to Extended License users for free. To get access to the calculator, please send your purchase code at following link along with your request. After verification, we will provide you access to the calculator.

## How to use the calculator:

Calculator is self-explanatory and easy to use. It contains information notes to guide you through the process.

You can find green and orange cells in the calculator. Green cells are inputs to define the ratios and orange cells are outputs to show the calculated ratios. Basically, you need to define total amount of the credits you want to sell per 1 USD and define the profit margin. The calculator will automatically calculate the credit conversion ratios for you to use in the Admin UI.

Later on at the below of the calculator, you can define pricing plans in your own currency and the calculator will automatically calculate the maximum credits that can be used in each plan according to the defined profit margin.
