Learn how to use the unified credit system in Aikeedo to manage usage credits in plans. {% .lead %}

With the release of Aikeedo v2.0, all previous usage units (tokens, image count and audio seconds) are replaced with a single unit: Credits. This change simplifies the usage management process and allows you to define credit conversion ratios in the Admin UI.

We've also introduced a calculator (available through Google Sheets) to help you calculate credit conversion ratios. The calculator is available for free to Extended License users.

## Access the calculator:

You can access the calculator at the following link: [Aikeedo Price Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-os2ma8zigwwx-HMFPk7DvfS4rKNGcjk5VZfB-YbFo/edit#gid=0)

{% callout type="warning" title="Important" %}
The calculator is not part of the item and is available only to Extended License users for free. To get access to the calculator, please send your purchase code at following link along with your request. After verification, we will provide you access to the calculator.
