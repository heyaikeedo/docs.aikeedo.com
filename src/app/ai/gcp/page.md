Enhance your Aikeedo platform with Google Cloud Platform's advanced AI capabilities. This guide walks you through setting up and leveraging GCP's powerful text-to-speech services for high-quality voice generation.{% .lead %}

## Introduction

Aikeedo's Google Cloud Platform integration unlocks advanced text-to-speech capabilities for your platform. With access to a wide range of high-quality voices, GCP's services can significantly enhance your VoiceOver tool and audio content creation.

## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these steps to connect Google Cloud Platform with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Obtain Your GCP Service Account Credentials

1. If you don't have a Google Cloud Platform account, [sign up here](https://cloud.google.com/). You'll need to provide some basic information and a valid payment method to create an account.

2. Once logged in, access the Google Cloud Console:

   - Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).
   - If this is your first time, you'll be prompted to create a new project. Otherwise, you can create a new project or select an existing one from the top-left dropdown menu.

3. Enable the Text-to-Speech API for your project:

   - In the Cloud Console, go to the "APIs & Services" page.
   - Click on the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button at the top.
   - Search for "Cloud Text-to-Speech API" and select it.
   - Click the "ENABLE" button to activate the API for your project.

4. Create a service account and download the JSON key file:
   - Navigate to the [IAM & Admin > Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page in the Cloud Console.
   - Click the "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT" button at the top of the page.
   - Enter a name for your service account (e.g., "aikeedo-tts-service"), and optionally add a description.
   - Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE".
   - In the "Grant this service account access to project" section, you can skip this step as it's not necessary for our use case.
   - Click "CONTINUE" and then "DONE" to finish creating the service account.
   - On the Service Accounts page, find the account you just created and click the three dots menu on the right.
   - Select "Manage keys" from the dropdown.
   - Click "ADD KEY" and choose "Create new key".
   - Select "JSON" as the key type and click "CREATE".
   - The JSON key file will be automatically downloaded to your computer. Keep this file secure, as it contains sensitive information.

{% callout type="warning" %}
The JSON key file you've downloaded contains credentials that grant access to your GCP project and its resources. Treat it like a password and never share it publicly or commit it to version control systems.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="note" %}
Keep your service account JSON key file secure and confidential. It grants access to your GCP services and should not be shared publicly.
{% /callout %}

### Step 2: Configure Aikeedo

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Google Cloud Platform Settings**.
3. In the "Service account" section, click "Choose file" and select the JSON key file you downloaded from GCP.
4. Click **Save changes** to activate the integration.

## Available Voice Types

Aikeedo leverages GCP's Text-to-Speech service, which offers a variety of voice types:

- Standard voices
- Premium voices
- Studio voices

These voice types offer different levels of quality and naturalness, allowing you to choose the best fit for your specific use case.

## Aikeedo Tools Powered by GCP

Google Cloud Platform integration enhances the following Aikeedo tool:

1. **VoiceOver**: Transform text into high-quality, natural-sounding speech using a wide range of voices and languages.

## Best Practices

To make the most of your GCP integration:

- Experiment with different voice types (Standard, Premium, Studio) to find the best fit for your use case.
- Consider the language and accent requirements of your project when selecting voices.
- Monitor your API usage to manage costs effectively.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the GCP integration, try these steps:

1. Verify that your service account JSON key file is correct and active.
2. Check your GCP project for any usage limits or restrictions.
3. Ensure the Text-to-Speech API is enabled for your project.
4. Confirm you have sufficient credit balance in your GCP account.
5. For voice-specific issues, verify that your account has access to the required voice types.
6. If you receive error messages related to authentication or API calls, double-check your service account permissions.
7. If problems persist, contact [Aikeedo support](mailto:support@aikeedo.com) for assistance.
