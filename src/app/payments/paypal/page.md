## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a [PayPal business](https://www.paypal.com/us/business) account before proceeding. Additionally, have your PayPal API secret key, client ID and Webhook Id ready, as these are essential for enabling PayPal recurring payments.

   - Visit [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/).
   - Log in with your PayPal business account credentials.

2. **Select Live or Sandbox:**

   - On the Apps & Credentials page, click Live or Sandbox depending on whether you need an app for testing (Sandbox) or going live (Live).

3. **Create a New App:**

   - In the PayPal Developer Dashboard, navigate to [My Apps & Credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox).
